  <summary><b>My Experience</b></summary>
I started programming as a hobby in highschool using Unity and C# using Visual Studio. I eventually was able to take some web design and Python programming classes in highschool, allowing me to learn about HTML, JavaScript, Python, and Python's turtle graphics library.<br>
I continued using C# with Unity as a hobby entering college and took a C programming course, in where we mainly used C++. Since then, I've continued to use C# in Unity and have started to create personal projects in C++ to expand\display my knowledge.
