  <summary><b>My Experience Summary</b></summary>
I started programming as a hobby using <b>Unity</b> and <b>C# using Visual Studio</b>.<br>I eventually was able to take some web design and Python programming classes, allowing me to learn about <b>HTML, JavaScript, Python, and Python's turtle graphics library.</b><br>
I continued using <b>C# with Unity</b> as a hobby and took a <b>C++ programming course</b>, where I also learned the basics of C programming. Since then, I've continued to use C# in Unity and have started to create <b>personal projects in C++</b> to expand\display my knowledge. As well starting to branch out to other things, such as diving into <b>Java for creating a Minecraft mod using Forge by using IntelliJ.</b>
